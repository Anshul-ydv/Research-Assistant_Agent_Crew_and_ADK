research_strategy_development:
  description: Analyze the research topic "{research_topic}" and develop a comprehensive
    research strategy. Break down the topic into 5-7 key subtopics and research areas.
    Create optimized search queries for academic databases. Identify the most relevant
    research domains, time periods to focus on, and key concepts that should be explored.
    Output should include specific search terms, Boolean operators, and research focus
    areas.
  expected_output: 'A detailed research strategy document containing: (1) 5-7 key
    subtopics and research areas, (2) 10-15 optimized search queries with Boolean
    operators, (3) recommended time frame for literature search, (4) key research
    domains to explore, and (5) important concepts and terminology to include in searches.'

academic_paper_collection:
  description: 'STEP 1: Use ArxivPaperTool to search for "{research_topic}" papers
    on ArXiv. STEP 2: Use SerplyScholarSearchTool to search for "{research_topic}"
    in academic databases with queries like "solar energy efficiency", "photovoltaic
    systems", "solar panel performance". STEP 3: Use ScrapeWebsiteTool to get additional
    details from any paper URLs found. Document each search attempt. If tools return
    no results, state "No papers found despite tool searches" - do NOT create fictional
    papers.'
  expected_output: 'A list of REAL academic papers found through actual searches.
    For each paper, include: exact title, all author names, journal/conference, publication
    year, DOI/URL if available, and brief summary. If searches return no results,
    report "Search conducted but no papers retrieved" and list the specific search
    terms used. DO NOT create fictional papers with generic titles or fake author
    names.'

paper_content_extraction:
  description: 'Extract and organize key information from each collected research
    paper. For accessible papers, read full content when possible. For each paper,
    extract: methodology used, datasets/data sources, main findings/results, limitations
    mentioned, key contributions, and conclusions. Create structured summaries that
    capture the essence of each paper''s approach and findings related to "{research_topic}".'
  expected_output: 'Structured summaries for each paper containing: (1) methodology
    and approach, (2) datasets/data sources used, (3) key findings and results, (4)
    stated limitations, (5) main contributions, and (6) conclusions. Include comparison-ready
    format with consistent structure across all paper summaries.'

methodology_and_results_analysis:
  description: Conduct comprehensive analysis of research methodologies, experimental
    designs, and results from all extracted papers on "{research_topic}". Compare
    different approaches, identify patterns and trends, evaluate effectiveness of
    various methodologies, and highlight innovative techniques. Analyze how different
    datasets and approaches led to different outcomes. Create comparative analysis
    showing evolution of methods over time.
  expected_output: 'Comprehensive methodology analysis including: (1) comparison table
    of all methodologies used, (2) trends in research approaches over time, (3) effectiveness
    evaluation of different methods, (4) dataset analysis and comparison, (5) innovative
    techniques identification, and (6) methodology recommendations for future research.'

critical_literature_evaluation:
  description: Critically evaluate all research papers and findings on "{research_topic}".
    Identify limitations, methodological weaknesses, contradictory findings, and research
    gaps. Look for studies that might be missing important controls, have limited
    datasets, or draw conclusions that aren't fully supported. Identify areas where
    the current literature is insufficient and highlight contradictions between different
    studies.
  expected_output: 'Critical evaluation report containing: (1) identified limitations
    in current research, (2) methodological weaknesses and concerns, (3) contradictory
    findings between studies with analysis, (4) significant research gaps and unexplored
    areas, (5) questions raised by current literature, and (6) recommendations for
    addressing identified issues.'

comprehensive_literature_review_synthesis:
  description: 'Synthesize all research findings, analyses, and critical evaluations
    into a comprehensive literature review document for "{research_topic}". Create
    a well-structured academic document with clear sections: Introduction, Paper Summaries,
    Methodology Analysis, Key Findings, Research Gaps, and Future Directions. Include
    comparison tables and actionable insights. Ensure the review tells a coherent
    story about the current state of research in this field.'
  expected_output: 'A complete literature review document in markdown format with:
    (1) Executive Summary, (2) Introduction to the research area, (3) Individual paper
    summaries organized by theme, (4) Methodology comparison table, (5) Key findings
    and trends analysis, (6) Research gaps and limitations, (7) Future research directions,
    and (8) Conclusion. Also provide a separate JSON metadata file with structured
    information about all analyzed papers.'
