A total of 564 individuals\nfrom the United States participated in our experiment. They were asked to read\na vignette outlining one of four hypothetical technology products and then\ncomplete a related survey. Three forms of attention check (logic, honesty, and\ntime) were used to assess attentiveness. Through this experiment we determined\nthat a total of 126 (22.3%) participants failed at least one of the three forms\nof attention check, with most (94) failing the honesty check - followed by the\nlogic check (31), and the time check (27). Thus, we established that\nsignificant levels of inattentiveness exist even among the most elite MTurk\nworkers. The study concludes by reaffirming the need for multiple forms of\ncarefully crafted attention checks, irrespective of whether participant quality\nis presumed to be high according to MTurk criteria such as 'Master', 'Approval\nRate', and 'Number of HITS approved'. Furthermore, we propose that researchers\nadjust their proposals to account for the effort and costs required to address\nparticipant inattentiveness.",
