<strong>Abstract summary:</strong> This paper provides a comprehensive survey of Machine Learning Testing (ML
testing) research. It covers 144 papers on testing properties (e.g.,
correctness, robustness, and fairness), testing components (e.g., the data,
learning program, and framework), testing workflow (e.g., test generation and
test evaluation), and application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, machine
translation). The paper also analyses trends concerning datasets, research
trends, and research focus, concluding with research challenges and promising
research directions in ML testing.
