<h3>1. The Hidden Cost of Using Amazon Mechanical Turk for Research (2021)</h3><em>Authors:</em> Antonios Saravanos, Stavros Zervoudakis, Dongnanzi Zheng, Neil Stott, Bohdan Hawryluk, Donatella Delfino

<strong>Abstract summary:</strong> In this study, we investigate the attentiveness exhibited by participants
sourced through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), thereby discovering a
significant level of inattentiveness amongst the platform's top crowd workers
(those classified as 'Master', with an 'Approval Rate' of 98% or more, and a
'Number of HITS approved' value of 1,000 or more). A total of 564 individuals
from the United States participated in our experiment. They were asked to read
a vignette outlining one of four hypothetical technology products and then
complete a related survey. Three forms of attention check (logic, hon...

<h3>2. Static and Dynamic Quality Assurance by Aspect Oriented Techniques (2010)</h3><em>Authors:</em> Christoph Knabe

<strong>Abstract summary:</strong> The overall goal of the described research project was to create applicable
quality assurance patterns for Java software systems using the aspect-oriented
programming language extension AspectJ 5. We tried to develop aspects to check
static quality criteria as a variable mutator convention and architectural
layering rules. We successfully developed aspects for automating the following
dynamic quality criteria: Parameterized Exception Chaining, Comfortable
Declaration of Parameterized Exceptions, Not-Null Checking of Reference
Variables.
