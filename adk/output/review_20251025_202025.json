Integrating Cascade Pumped Micro-Hydro Storage: A Sustainable Approach\n  to Energy and Water Management (2024)</h3><p><em>Authors:</em> Oraib Dawaghreh, Sharaf K. Magableh, Xuesong Wang, Mohammad Adnan Magableh, Caisheng Wang</p><p><strong>Abstract summary:</strong> As traditional large hydropower has been extensively exploited, micro-hydro\nsystems have caught research increasing interest. New engineering challenges\narise in developing micro-hydro systems in areas with significant elevation but\nprohibitive horizontal distances between primary reservoirs. This study\naddresses these challenges by proposing a cascade-pumped micro-hydro storage\n(CPMHS) system that leverages intermediate reservoirs to bridge long horizontal\ndistances, enabling efficient energy transfer and storage. The methodology\nutilizes naturally occurring lakes with substantial head height...</p><p><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00262v2\">View Paper</a></p><h3>2.

The spectrum of SN 2017gpn is\nconsistent with a Type IIb supernova. In this work we present the photometry of\n20 epochs of observations performed with CCD-photometer on the Zeiss-1000\ntelescope. The light curves in B and Rc filters were obtained.

Exploring the partonic collectivity in small systems at the LHC (2024)</h3><p><em>Authors:</em> Yuanyuan Wang, Wenbin Zhao, Huichao Song</p><p><strong>Abstract summary:</strong> Using the Hydro-Coal-Frag model that combines hydrodynamics at low $p_{\\rm\nT}$, quark coalescence at intermediate $p_{\\rm T}$, and the LBT transport model\nat high $p_{\\rm T}$, we study the spectra and elliptic flow of identified\nhadrons in high multiplicity p--Pb and p--p collisions at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). In p--Pb collisions, the Hydro-Coal-Frag model gives a good\ndescription of the differential elliptic flow over the $p_{\\rm T}$ range from 0\nto 6 GeV and the approximate number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling at\nintermediate $p_{\\rm T}$.
