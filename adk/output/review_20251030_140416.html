<h2>Per-paper Summaries</h2>
<h3>1. "Weak AI" is Likely to Never Become "Strong AI", So What is its Greatest
  Value for us? (2021)</h3><p><em>Authors:</em> Bin Liu</p><p><strong>Abstract summary:</strong> AI has surpassed humans across a variety of tasks such as image
classification, playing games (e.g., go, "Starcraft" and poker), and protein
structure prediction. However, at the same time, AI is also bearing serious
controversies. Many researchers argue that little substantial progress has been
made for AI in recent decades. In this paper, the author (1) explains why
controversies about AI exist; (2) discriminates two paradigms of AI research,
termed "weak AI" and "strong AI" (a.k.a. artificial general intelligence); (3)
clarifies how to judge which paradigm a research work should be classifi...</p><p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15294v1">View Paper</a></p>
