<h3>1. Integrating Cascade Pumped Micro-Hydro Storage: A Sustainable Approach
  to Energy and Water Management (2024)</h3><p><em>Authors:</em> Oraib Dawaghreh, Sharaf K. Magableh, Xuesong Wang, Mohammad Adnan Magableh, Caisheng Wang</p><p><strong>Abstract summary:</strong> As traditional large hydropower has been extensively exploited, micro-hydro
systems have caught research increasing interest. New engineering challenges
arise in developing micro-hydro systems in areas with significant elevation but
prohibitive horizontal distances between primary reservoirs. This study
addresses these challenges by proposing a cascade-pumped micro-hydro storage
(CPMHS) system that leverages intermediate reservoirs to bridge long horizontal
distances, enabling efficient energy transfer and storage. The methodology
utilizes naturally occurring lakes with substantial head height...</p><p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00262v2">View Paper</a></p><h3>2. Photometry and preliminary modelling of Type IIb Supernova 2017gpn (2018)</h3><p><em>Authors:</em> Maria Pruzhinskaya, Elena Balakina, Alexander Moskvitin, Sergey Blinnikov</p><p><strong>Abstract summary:</strong> MASTER OT J033744.97+723159.0/SN 2017gpn was discovered in the error-box of
LIGO/Virgo G299232 gravitational wave alert. The spectrum of SN 2017gpn is
consistent with a Type IIb supernova. In this work we present the photometry of
20 epochs of observations performed with CCD-photometer on the Zeiss-1000
telescope. The light curves in B and Rc filters were obtained. The multicolour
light curves were also modelled numerically using the one-dimensional radiation
hydro-dynamical code STELLA.</p><p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04861v1">View Paper</a></p><h3>3. Introducing OpenMP Tasks into the HYDRO Benchmark (2021)</h3><p><em>Authors:</em> Jérémie Gaidamour, Dimitri Lecas, Pierre-François Lavallée</p><p><strong>Abstract summary:</strong> The HYDRO mini-application has been successfully used as a research vehicle
in previous PRACE projects [6]. In this paper, we evaluate the benefits of the
tasking model introduced in recent OpenMP standards [9]. We have developed a
new version of HYDRO using the concept of OpenMP tasks and this implementation
is compared to already existing and optimized OpenMP versions of HYDRO.</p><p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13465v1">View Paper</a></p><h3>4. Dataset after seven years simulating hybrid energy systems with Homer
  Legacy (2020)</h3><p><em>Authors:</em> Alexandre Beluco, Frederico A. During Filho, Lucia M. R. Silva, Jones S. Silva, Luis E. Teixeira, Gabriel Vasco, Fausto A. Canales, Elton G. Rossini, Jose de Souza, Giuliano C. Daronco, Alfonso Risso</p><p><strong>Abstract summary:</strong> Homer Legacy software is a well-known software for simulation of small hybrid
systems that can be used for both design and research. This dataset is a set of
files generated by Homer Legacy bringing the simulation results of hybrid
energy systems over the last seven years, as a consequence of the research work
led by Dr. Alexandre Beluco, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, in
southern Brazil. The data correspond to thirty papers published in the last
seven years. Two of them describe hydro PV hybrid systems with photovoltaic
panels operating on the water surface of reservoirs. One of the...</p><p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07604v1">View Paper</a></p><h3>5. Exploring the partonic collectivity in small systems at the LHC (2024)</h3><p><em>Authors:</em> Yuanyuan Wang, Wenbin Zhao, Huichao Song</p><p><strong>Abstract summary:</strong> Using the Hydro-Coal-Frag model that combines hydrodynamics at low $p_{\rm
T}$, quark coalescence at intermediate $p_{\rm T}$, and the LBT transport model
at high $p_{\rm T}$, we study the spectra and elliptic flow of identified
hadrons in high multiplicity p--Pb and p--p collisions at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). In p--Pb collisions, the Hydro-Coal-Frag model gives a good
description of the differential elliptic flow over the $p_{\rm T}$ range from 0
to 6 GeV and the approximate number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling at
intermediate $p_{\rm T}$. Although Hydro-Coal-Frag model can also ...</p><p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00913v1">View Paper</a></p>
