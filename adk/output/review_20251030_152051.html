<h3>1. Learning with Digital Agents: An Analysis based on the Activity Theory (2024)</h3><p><em>Authors:</em> Mateusz Dolata, Dzmitry Katsiuba, Natalie Wellnhammer, Gerhard Schwabe</p><p><strong>Abstract summary:</strong> Digital agents are considered a general-purpose technology. They spread
quickly in private and organizational contexts, including education. Yet,
research lacks a conceptual framing to describe interaction with such agents in
a holistic manner. While focusing on the interaction with a pedagogical agent,
i.e., a digital agent capable of natural-language interaction with a learner,
we propose a model of learning activity based on activity theory. We use this
model and a review of prior research on digital agents in education to analyze
how various characteristics of the activity, including featu...</p><p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04304v1">View Paper</a></p>
